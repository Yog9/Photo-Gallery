# Photo Gallery
[Demo Photo Gallery Here](https://yog9.github.io/Photo-Gallery/)

## Summary
Photo Gallery is an interactive photo gallery build using JavaScript and a jQuery plugin for a lightbox.The page is built using a mobile first, responsive design. It also has a search box funtionality that filters the photos in real-time as the user types, and only display photos that match the search.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to  get comfortable with HTML/CSS/ Responsive design / JQuery Plugin.

### Getting Started
 1. Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 2. Click on thumbnail images in the gallery and view them in a larger lightbox.
 3. Click on the back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
 4. Type into the search-box to filter the gallery images  based on the captions like 'Lake' or 'Mountain'.
 5. Exit out with a click outside of the image or the X.
 
  ### Thoughts
It was a fun project to build and I felt comfortable throughout the project and even when I struggled with my JavaScript function for the search functionality, I was able to think through it and figure out where I was erroring. It was the first time I started using grid for layouts.It took me some time to figure out which plugin I needed to use in order to implement all the features . Need to code lightbox myself rather than using a lightbox plugin.
