# Photo Gallery
[Demo Photo Gallery Here](https://yog9.github.io/Photo-Gallery/)

## Summary
Photo Gallery is an interactive photo gallery build using JavaScript and a jQuery plugin for a lightbox. The page is built using mobile first and responsive design principals. It also has a search box functionality that filters the photos in real-time as the user types, and only display photos that match the search.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to get comfortable using HTML5, CSS3, responsive design principals and a jQuery Plugin [Lightbox 2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/).

### Getting Started
 1. Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 2. Click on thumbnail images in the gallery to view them in a larger lightbox.
 3. Click on the back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
 4. Type into the search-box to filter the gallery images  based on the captions like 'Lake' or 'Mountain'.
 5. Exit out with a click outside of the image or the X.
 
  ### Thoughts
It was a fun project to build and I felt comfortable throughout the project and even when I struggled with my JavaScript function for implementing the search functionality, I was able to think through it and figure out where I was erroring. It was the first time I started using a grid for CSS layouts. It took me some time to figure out which plugin I needed to use in order to implement all the features. Also, I need to create my own custom lightbox rather than using a  plugin.
